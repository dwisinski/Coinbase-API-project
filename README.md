### Task 1.2:
Download a full day of production trade history of ETH/BTC exchange: Coinbase Pro - "https://docs.pro.coinbase.com". Endpoint: GET "/products/<product-id>/trades" (make sure this is the raw trade data). Store the data in a DataFrame.

Produce a report for ETH/BTC showing notional volume in USD.

### Task 2:
<em>Describe how you would approach assessing the number of confirmations that a Digital Asset Exchange should wait before it considers a transaction (deposit to the exchange) in the BTC blockchain as valid in order to minimize the risk of being affected by a potential reorganization in the blockchain, but also not having a negative impact on the user experience (making the user wait for too long).

What measures, data and calculations would you look at to determine how many blockchain confirmations an exchange should wait when a client makes a BTC deposit before making the funds available for client to trade with?</em>
